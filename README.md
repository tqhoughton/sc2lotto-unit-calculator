# SC2 Arcade - Lottery Defence Unit Calculator

https://tqhoughton.github.io/sc2lotto-unit-calculator/

## Summary
This project was a personal attempt to learn Typescript, as well as master basic Javascript DOM manipulation. It reads in unit data from a `units.js` file, and then creates class instances for each object, in this case the class `Unit` or its extension, `Recipe`. It also creates a class called `NodeItem` which assists in recursively creating the list of units required for each Recipe.

The DOM manipulation is done by the form elements in the header, as they let you choose which types of units to display as well as the type of recipe you would like to show.
